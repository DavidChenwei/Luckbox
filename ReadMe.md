# Introducation
- This application can help live streamers who are on Penguin Esports platform to calculate their profit in real-time.
- The UI part is implemented by pyqt5.
- As there is no UI designer to help me design a beautiful UI, the interface of the application looks not very nice. However, it's still a really useful toolã€‚
- The bad news is that Penguin Esports went out of business on July 6, and the software can no longer be used on this platform. But its design ideas can be used for other more similar live platforms

# Functions
- Monitor the gifts received in the streamer's live room.
- Calculate the actual revenue the streamer gets from the gift.

- Calculate the difference between the income obtained from the gift and the actual expenditure to achieve the purpose of monitoring the income of live streamers in real-time.
- Set your own refund amount
